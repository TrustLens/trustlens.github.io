<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The MQTT-PLAN ontology defines a set of concepts for describing plans of MQTT enabled message brokers. The vocabulary for plan descriptions forms an extension to the high level concepts defined in P-PLAN. Execution trace of such plans is then modelled using PROV-O.

In order to keep the vocabulary lightweight, this version of the ontology does not cover some of the functionalities specified in MQTT 3.1.1. These include: publish attributes defining the required quality of service and associated acknowledgments, will messages,  retaining of messages by the server, session flags. Username and password flags are also not captured explicitly for security reasons.

Should these features be required, they may be incorporated in future revisons of the ontology. Please contact the authors with your suggestions.</p>
