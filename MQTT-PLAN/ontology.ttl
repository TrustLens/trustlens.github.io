These include: message attributes defining the required quality of service and associated acknowledgments, will messages,  retaining of messages by the server, session flags. Username and password flags are also not captured explicitly for security reasons.

Should these features be required, they may be incorporated in future revisons of the ontology. Please contact the authors with your suggestions."""@en ;
